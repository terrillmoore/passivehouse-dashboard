Dashboard source code and procedures for the PassiveHouse Ecovillage project.

- `grafana-dashboard.json` is the source for the Grafana dashboard; it can be imported, and should work immediately.
- `node-red-flows.json` is the source for the Node-RED flows. It can be imported, but you'll have to change the access key to match the application.
- `PROCEDURES.md` is a record of interesting procedures on the database.
